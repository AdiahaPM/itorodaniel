# Hi, I’m Itoro Daniel!

I’m a Product Manager with a growing love for tech, strategy, and storytelling. I’ve worked across product development, operations, and compliance and I enjoy bringing clarity, structure, and human-centered thinking into every project.

### What I’m into:
- Building inclusive, user-focused products
- Learning more about full stack product management
- Supporting teams with clear documentation and processes
- Exploring AI and marketplaces in African tech

### Things I work with:
- Product tools: Notion, Trello, Figma, Miro, Jira, Clickup
- Basic HTML, CSS, JS and SQL (always learning more!)
- PRDs, BRDs, GTM strategies, product research

### Projects I care about:
- **FarmFoodHub** – helping farmers connect better with buyers  
- **TiXstash** – simplifying event access and experience through technology  
- **Elderee** – creating a safe space for the elderly through technology
